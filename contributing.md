# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Alphasians/AINA/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports 🔎.

Since the new GitHub Issue forms we only suggest you to include most information possible. But you can also **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/Alphasians/AINA/issues)** to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions 🔎.
