Documentation for "Music commands" and "Mod commands" of AinaBot.

Music commands:
1)Play:- The Bot responds to "play" a command, it plays any song or playlist from youtube.(Only if you are member of the channel or doesn't have permission assigned for this role.) If the given song or playlist link is private, it will respond with a 'Playlist is either private or it does not exist!'. If the link is not reachable also, it will respond with a error message. If all went right, the song or playlist will be played or if a song is currently playing, it will be added to queue.
