## Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to AINA's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for AINA. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement. You can view the data upon request from[`@Sonichigo`](https://github.com/Sonichigo).

## Storage of Data

Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and AINA's owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.

- Command Usage Logs for that server.
- Custom config settings for that server.
- User data associated with that server (e.g. level data)

## User Rights
